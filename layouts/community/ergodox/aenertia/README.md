## aenertia's modified ergodox infinity layout

## Uses a kinesis like layout with some modifications from 333fred's layout/vis


##notes

Uses a modified viz library from the main qmk and differing ugfx compile time options to enable wordwrap and 4 line output on the 128x32 LCD

Currently I am only testing on a Single RightHand PCB - as Massdrop/Input Club shipped me two Right hand sides. 

In theory just compiling two different visualization.c for the left and right should be fine. But I am not sure about the the async code in qmk and can't currently test
